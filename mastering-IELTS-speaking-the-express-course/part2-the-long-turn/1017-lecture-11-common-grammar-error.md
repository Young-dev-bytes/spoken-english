## Getting Started

One area you really shouldn’t be messing up is your introduction.
Do NOT try to start with some fancily-worded, complicated opening line. Keep things simple and accurate. Steady your nerves with a grammatically solid introduction.

Two options:
I’m going to talk about ...
I’d like to talk about ...

### example:

I’m going to talk about my dog, whose name is Ellie.
I’d like to talk about my holiday to Spain, which we took last April.
I’m going to talk about my best friend, whose name is Jack.
I’d like to talk about a competition I took part in last year, which was for all the math majors at my university.
I’m going to talk about my first job, which was as a retail assistant.
I’d like to talk about my favourite book, which is called ‘Great Expectations’ and was written by Charles Dickens.

<span style="color:red">Describe a sport you used to do.</span>
You should say:
when and where you did it
how often you did this sport
who you did this sport with and explain what you liked and/or disliked about this sport.

I’m going to talk about football, which is a sport I used to play around ten years ago.

In fact, I still play it now when I have the opportunity, but not competitively. As a kid, I **play** football all the time. I was part of a local football team, and every Saturday we **go** to the sports centre to compete with kids from other local teams.

It was just once a week we play football, but I wish it was more. I used to look forward to the games every week. I still sometimes think about joining a competitive team as an adult.
My teammates were all my friends, and we all get along well. Sometimes there were fights and arguments, but these are rare. I remember our last game together; I score an own goal and my friends were so angry, but then I score at the right end and all that anger disappear!
I guess I liked football so much because I have quite a competitive spirit, I’ve always had a lot of drive to win. Football gives me the chance to tap into that drive, it gives me a huge adrenaline rush.
