## Getting Started

One area you really shouldn’t be messing up is your introduction.
Do NOT try to start with some fancily-worded, complicated opening line. Keep things simple and accurate. Steady your nerves with a grammatically solid introduction.

Two options:
I’m going to talk about ...
I’d like to talk about ...

### example:

I’m going to talk about my dog, whose name is Ellie.
I’d like to talk about my holiday to Spain, which we took last April.
I’m going to talk about my best friend, whose name is Jack.
I’d like to talk about a competition I took part in last year, which was for all the math majors at my university.
I’m going to talk about my first job, which was as a retail assistant.
I’d like to talk about my favourite book, which is called ‘Great Expectations’ and was written by Charles Dickens.
