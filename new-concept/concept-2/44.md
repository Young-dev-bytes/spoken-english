Lesson 44 Through the forest 穿过森林

How did Mrs. Sterling get her bag back?

Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men. They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag. In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their possession, both men started running through the trees. Mrs. Sterling got so angry that she ran after them. She was soon out of breath, but she continued to run. When she caught up with them, she saw that they had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag, so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright that they dropped the bag and ran away. 'The strap needs mending,' said Mrs. Sterling later, 'but they did not steal anything.'

安·斯特林夫人在穿过森林追赶两个男人时，她并没有考虑到所冒的风险。刚才，当她和孩子们正在森林边上野餐的时候，这两个人冲到她跟前，企图抢走她的手提包。在争抢中，手提包的带断了，包落入这两个人手里，他们拔腿跑进了树林。斯特林夫人非常气愤，向着他们追了过去。只追了一会儿便上气不接下气了，但她还是继续追赶。当她赶上他们时，发现他们已经坐了下来，正翻着包里的东西。于是她直冲过去。这两个人吓了一跳，扔下提包逃跑了。“这提包带需要修理，”斯特林夫人事后说道，“不过他们什么也没偷走。”

语法要点

动名词
在第 20 课的语法中，我们学习了动名词的形式和一般作用，知道它可以代替名词作句子的主语、宾语、介词宾语等，也学习了它的否定式和完成式：
Washing the car made me tired.
擦洗汽车使我很累。（主语）
I enjoy reading.
我喜爱读书。（宾语）
Before leaving the office, he gave me a book.
他离开办公室之前给了我一本书。（介词宾语）
（1）动名词还可以用于动词+介词之后：
We are looking forward to his coming.
我们盼望着他的到来。
（2）在 start，begin， continue 等后面，既可以用不定式又可以用动名词，区别不大：
I began to learn/ learning English two years ago.
我两年前开始学英语。
（3）在 love，like，prefer 等动词后面，用不定式和动名词意义有所区别。带不定式时常表示特定的未来的事件（如正准备做某事或建议做某事），带动名词形式时则表示目前正在进行中的活动或一般的行为。在 prefer…to…结构中则只能用动名词
我喜欢看电视。（一般行为）
（4）在 need，want 之后，动名词形式具有被动的含义，相当于被动的不定式：
The windows need cleaning.
这些窗子该擦了。（=need to be cleaned）
His shirt needs washing.
他的衬衣该洗了。
