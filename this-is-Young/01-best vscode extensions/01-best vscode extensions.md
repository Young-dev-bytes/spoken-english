## vscode pets

let me introduce you yet another vscode extension, vscode pets, It's one of the funniest vscode extensions that I know yet, which allows you to add some cute animals to your code editor.
You see, you choose different pets that you like, you can give them a name and play with them as well.

it's really funny, but of course, you might find this distracting. However I mostly use my vscode with the sidebar closed, when I open it and see my pets here, they just make me smile for a momemt. But I know this doesn't apply to everyone, I just wanted to show there is such an interesting extension in vscode.

## prettier - code formatter

And the one that we're going to install for now is called prettier.
So just search for prettier.
And then it's probably going to be this first result here
because prettier is an extremely popular extension.
You see it has over 12 million downloads right now.
And so just go ahead and click install here
and then enable it.
Now what this extension does is to automatically format your code whenever you save it.
And this is going to be very important so that your code always looks exactly the same way as the code that
I am typing in the video,
because that way it will be way easier for you to find any
errors or any mistakes that you have in your own code.
So it will be easier for you to find and to fix mistakes
as you're working on your own codes.
Okay. And for now,

So now let's come down here to this settings icon,
then choose settings from here so that we can now see a
couple of settings.
And let's actually start with two settings that are related
to the prettier extension that we just installed.
So just come here to the search bar.
So searching for the setting name is actually the easiest
way of finding them.
So just type here, default formatter.
And so here, we actually need to set it to prettier.
So I already have it set of course,
but you will have to go through this list
and find prettier somewhere here.
So it is right here.
So, choose prettier code formatter,
Okay.
And so now vs code knows that it should use that prettier
extension that we just installed to format your code.
Now, when should it actually format your code?
Well, we need to set another setting for that,
which is the format on safe setting.
So it's this one here, and here
you need to check this checkbox so that prettier will
automatically format your file each time
that you save it.
Okay.
Another one that is very important is the auto safe setting.
So auto safe, we need to set it to onFocusChange.
And what this will do is to automatically save your files as
you go to another tab or as you leave the window completely.
And so this is very important so that you never lose your
edits and so that you don't have to manually save your files
all the time.
So set this one to onFocusChange again.

And another one that I like to use,
and I'm not sure if this is actually the default already
is to set the tab size to two.
And so in this case, this is just again,
so that your code looks exactly the same way as my code.
So the tab size is basically just the indentation of the
code and you will know what that means a little bit later,
once we start writing HTML, okay.

And now finally, let's talk about these colors.
So basically we can customize vs code with a color theme,
which will then change the colors of the code editor itself
and also of the code.
So it will basically highlight different parts of the code
with different colors.
Now, this is just a thing of personal preference.
So you can just use the theme that already comes
automatically by default with vs code.
But I choose to install a special theme that I believe makes
it very easy to read the code.

And this one is called One Monokai.
So this very first one here, and as you can see down here,
it will give our code these kinds of colors,
and also the vs code editor itself will
have this blue color that you can see already here
in this window.
So if you want to use this color theme as well to make your
editor look exactly the same as mine,

then just go ahead and once again,

download this extension and then set the color theme using

this option here.
And you can also experiment with some other themes,
of course, down here, again, in the settings icon.
And then here in color theme,
you can choose one of these light themes or one of these
dark themes.
So vs code already comes with a bunch of themes
pre-installed basically.
And so you can try them out as well.

Or if you have another preference,
you can also install any other theme that you would like.
Finally, there's just one more small thing,
which is these file I can theme.
So this doesn't really matter,
but I set mine to this option here. So Seti.
And so again,
if you want your editor to look just like mine,
you can also go ahead and choose this option.
Okay, then that we are done setting up vs code for now.
So now you're actually ready to write
your very first line of code.
And so that's exactly what we're going to do

## image preview

> the next one is the image priview. as a web developer dealing with images can be tough. Because we use a great many of images on our websites, such as photos, logos, icons. sometimes, it's hard to remember which image you are working on. especial you are using long URLs and files with random names, to see the image, you have to visit that image URL or the folder path.But when you install this extension, you see images on the left-hand side of the editor. or you can just hover over the image and see its image size, file size and the image itself.

## auto renamed tag
