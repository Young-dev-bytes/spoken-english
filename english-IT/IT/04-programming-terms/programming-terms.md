Programming Terms Part 1

1.  Algorithm
    > Algorithms are implemented with code.
    > I used a Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the numbers in an array.
2.  Value
    > value is a piece of data, Every value has type,
    > if you write your birth year into the field, the program will use that value to calculate your age
3.  Variable
    > a container for a single value. It is named. Different values can be assigned to a variable.
    > var name; var age
    > I created the age and the name variables in my js file.
4.  Assign
    > to put a value into a variable. the process is called assignment.
    > var age = 34;
    > I assigned the number 27 to the age variable.
5.  Integer
    > a type of value that represents whole numbers. Ð¡an be positive, negative, or zero.
    > 27 is an Integer value
6.  Float
    > a type of value that is a number with a fractional part. short for "floating-point number"
    > 27.34 is a float
7.  Double
    > a data type that is a number with decimal points. It has more precision than float.
    > 32.4432345 is a double
8.  String
    > a string is type of value that represents text, the term is short for "string(sequence) of characters"
    > "english" is a string, it's a sequence of characters "e" "n" "g" "l"
9.  Boolean
    > var empty = true
    > a data type that has two values (that are usually called true and false).
    > I assigned the boolean value to the variable empty
10. Array
    > an array is a type of value that can contain a sequence of other value.
    > var arr = ["tom","jack"]
    > I created an array strings that contains the names of students.
11. Function
    > a piece of code that is run only when it is called(executed). It can take arguments(parameters). when a function finishes running, it returns a certain value.
    > I wrote a function that calculate the price for discounted products.
12. To call
    > to call a function is to run the code in a function.
    > your program doesn't work properly, because yo forgot to call that funtion.
13. Argument
    > a value that is passed into a function when it is called.
    > the function takes the original price of a product as an argument and returns the discounted price.
14. Parameter
15. Class
    > a class is a type that can be created by the programmer, we need a class to create a object of that class.
    > I made a student class that will be able to hold student's name and email address.
16. Object
    > a value created from a class. It usually contains variables and values inside and have methods attached to them.
    > I made a class student and then created several objects from that class-for every student in the group.
17. Method
    > a method is an function that is attached to an object.
    > the method called length returns the number of characters in a string object.
