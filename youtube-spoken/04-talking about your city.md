Sample conversation
Vanessa: Hey Dan!

Dan: Hey Vanessa! Are you excited for your trip to Rome?

Vanessa: I am excited! It’s so full of history. Are there any tourist traps I should avoid?

Dan: Yeah, avoid all the gelato shops except for this one. It’s off the beaten path but trust me, you don’t want to miss it.

Vanessa: Good to know! Any other “must sees”?

Dan: The Colosseum is great, but my favorite thing to do is wander around and see all
the little chapels. It’s usually more relaxed and less crowded that way.

Vanessa’s Challenge Question
Use the space below to write a few sentences answering this question.
Can you tell me about the city where you live?

Can you tell me about where you live?

(Sample answer: I live in Tokyo, one of the biggest cities in the world. Sometimes it’s way too busy and crowded, but there are plenty of parks to visit if you want some fresh air and a bit of calm. There are quite a few must-see attractions, but make sure to stay away from any restaurant that has a sign in English. Those are usually tourist traps. If you want authentic food, I can give you some good recommendations.)
