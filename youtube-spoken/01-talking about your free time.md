## Different Types of Free Time Activities

There are many types of free time activities. Sometimes we call these leisure activities, or hobbies and pastimes.
Here are some of the most common types of activities with some examples.

#### Indoor Activities

Playing games
Reading
Watching TV / Films
Chilling out / hanging out with friends

## Talking About Your Hobbies

So, how can you talk about what you do in your free time?
Well here are some common and also more advanced phrases to help you talk about your hobbies.
I get up to a lot things I don’t get up to much
To get up to = to do an activity
Of course, it is always better to say something and describe an
activity you do, rather than say, ‘I don’t have any hobbies’.
The most common way to talk about a hobby is

I like to do yoga
I like doing yoga

What’s the difference between ‘like doing' and ‘like to do’? We can use both to express enjoyment.
When I say, ‘I like doing yoga’ the focus is always on my enjoyment of the activity.
However, if I say, ‘I like to do yoga’ this can also mean that I am describing either a choice or a habit

For example,
I like to do yoga on Thursdays
This focusses on the fact that I choose to do it on Thursdays, not any other day, or that I have the habit of practicing on Thursdays.
Here are some more useful expressions to describe hobbies you love.
I’m fond of playing video games
I’m into playing video games
I’m passionate about playing video games

If you are less serious about doing a hobby and it is something you do casually, not seriously, you can say...
I like to dabble in cooking
I like to dabble in painting Sometimes, I dabble in investing
I play the guitar, but I am just an aficionado I play the guitar, but I am just an amateur
