#### Vanessa’s Challenge Question

Use the space below to write a few sentences answering this question.

What kind of birthday party do you want to have this year?

Tell me who you want to invite, what kind of food will be there, what kind of cake you want to have, and what kind of entertainment will be there
Sample answer: I am so excited for my birthday this year! I am inviting my friends to go to a wildlife reserve to see a bunch of wild animals, including American bison and water buffaloes. There is a popular pizza restaurant in the town we’re going to, so we’ll have lunch there. I didn’t really want a cake, so my mom is going to make a huge batch of my favorite cookies. I am so excited to see all the wild animals and take pictures of them.
